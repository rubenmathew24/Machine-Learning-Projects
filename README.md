# [Machine-Learning-Projects](https://rubenmathew24.github.io/Machine-Learning-Projects/)
Portfolio containing a few ML projects I've worked on while learning/experimenting

## [Introduction](MLIntroduction.pdf)
This is a brief introduction to Machine Learning. It tells you about the general concept of ML as well as a few different applications.

## [Project 1](Component1/):

In this project, I created some [statistical functions using C++](Component1/functions.cpp) in order to compare the power of R to other languages.  
It also contains some [descriptions of these functions](Component1/StatFunctions.pdf) and their usfulness in ML.
