# [Machine-Learning-Projects](https://rubenmathew24.github.io/Machine-Learning-Projects/)
Portfolio containing a few ML projects I've worked on while learning/experimenting

## [Introduction](MLIntroduction.pdf)
This is a brief introduction to Machine Learning. It tells you about the general concept of ML as well as a few different applications.

## [Project 1](Component1/):

In this project, I created some [statistical functions using C++](Component1/functions.cpp) in order to compare the power of R to other languages.  
It also contains some [descriptions of these functions](Component1/StatFunctions.pdf) and their usfulness in ML.

## [Project 2](Component2/):

In this project I created a couple of notebooks in R to test out some statistical functions. One notebook contains a few [regression](Component2/Regression.Rmd) models and the other notebook contains a couple [classification](Component2/Classification.Rmd) models. The used csv files are also included as well as a pdf version of the notebooks.

## [Project 3](Component3/):

In this project I created two C++ files recreating some regression functions manually. One file contains [logistic regression](Component3/logistic.cpp) functions and the other file contains [Naive Bayes](Component3/bayes.cpp) functions. The used csv file is also included as well as some documentation talking about the functions and the importance of reproducibile research.

## [Project 4](Component4/):

This project was a group project where we each created a notebook in R to show the power of different models using R. My [notebook](Component4/Part%202.Rmd) was based on different classification models such as Logistic Regression (previously explored), K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees. The used csv file is also included as well as a pdf version of the notebook.

## [Project 5](Component5/):

This project was a first look into using python for ML. I created a [notebook](Component5/Portfolio_5.ipynb) using python to explore the power of different models. The used csv file is also included as well as a pdf version of the notebook.

## [Project 6](Component6/):

This project was comparing different models that can be used for image classification. I created a [notebook](Component6/Portfolio_6.ipynb) to check different models like regualar Sequential, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Transfer Learning. The images used are also included and can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification/code?resource=download). There is also a pdf version of the notebook included.

## Summary:

This class and the projects above helped me learn important concepts in machine learning such as Regression, Classification, and Neural Networks. I also learned a new language (R) and a few libraries for Python such as Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, and Pandas. I hope to continue being able to use these skills for future projects. One idea I want to pursue later is making an opponent AI for a game using a neural network. I think it would be interesting to have an opponent that will adapt as more games are played against it.
